# CorgJS v0.2
Corg web framework for Single Page Applications

**This is a revamp of the current CorgJS Single Page Application framework**

Follow the following steps to use the dev environment:

```
npm install
npm start
```

The second command will use webpack to compile the application code in development mode and then move the compiled
bundle to public directory of the express app, which will then serve through port 3000 of localhost
